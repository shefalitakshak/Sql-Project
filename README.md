# Sql-Project
I have analyzed the data and solved 20+ SQL queries. 
The dataset I have used is the famous paintings dataset taken from Kaggle. I used a simple Python script to upload data from CSV files to PostgreSQL database tables. I then use SQL queries to answer over 20 problems related to the famous paintings dataset.
